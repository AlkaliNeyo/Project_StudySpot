# Project_StudySpot

**Project Study Spot** is an early-stage website designed to help students discover and rate study spots on their campus. Initially focused on York University, the platform allows students to share and review study locations based on key criteria like location convenience, quietness, food options, availability, and other relevant categories. The goal is to create a reliable, student-driven resource for finding the best places to study, with plans to expand to other campuses in the future.
